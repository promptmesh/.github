# Prompt Mesh

Promptmesh is a collection of open-source tools for working with LLMs using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

We build SDKs, APIs, and examples to make it easier to:

- Connect to MCP servers
- Use tools and prompts dynamically
- Read resources in a structured way

## Projects

- **[easymcp](https://github.com/promptmesh/easymcp)** – Python SDK for working with MCP servers
- **[SemanticTool](https://github.com/promptmesh/semantictool)** – Upcoming HTTP/GQL API built on top of `easymcp`
- **[RelayMCP](https://github.com/promptmesh/relaymcp)** - Upcoming OpenAPI to MCP gateway.

## Goals

- Keep things modular and composable
- Support local and remote tool execution
- Provide clean, typed interfaces for orchestration
- Build on top of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
